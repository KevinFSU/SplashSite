## Welcome to KevinYepes.net

You probably got to my business-card site by scanning my QR code, well aren't you curious? I hope my advertising style made you realize how cool data encoding can be, or at least made you smile! We have a vastly under-used feature of camera apps -- like Snapchat -- that are able to process encoded images like QR codes, so why don't we start using them more?

# About me
I'm a Cyber Criminology student at FSU interested in security, networking, programming, cars, and skateboarding. I have real job experience in Private Investigations, Security, and Automotive fabrication/repair. My position as CEO of beekeep, llc currently trails behind as I focus on my studies-- it's a side job/hobby for now. Although I am not currently accepting job offers of any kind, I invite you to follow me on social media to expand our networks! Please reach out to me with any questions or comments :)
