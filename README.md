You probably got to my business-card site by scanning my QR code, well aren't you curious? I hope my advertising style made you realize how cool data encoding can be, or at least made you smile! We have a vastly under-used feature of camera apps -- like Snapchat -- that are able to process encoded images like QR codes, so why don't we start using them more?

My position as CEO of beekeep, llc currently trails behind as I focus on my studies-- it's a side job/hobby for now.
